		    <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always held a fascination for how things work and an enjoyment for troubleshooting and solving various mechanical, electrical, and computer problems.&nbsp; My true passion lies in all things technological, but mostly robotics and its applications in space exploration.&nbsp; I also have a love for the arts, including photography, printmaking, and music.&nbsp; I particularly enjoy film photography because there is something magical about the complex process from choosing the right film, to creating the perfect shot and lastly, to developing the film. </p>
		    <p>These two worlds of interest coalesced through my experience serving on the Board for Jackson Hole MusicLand.&nbsp; MusicLand is a non-profit that focuses on musical education from preschool to high school and beyond.&nbsp; I have served on the board for more than 3 years, where my role has been the maintenance of their website.&nbsp; When I lived in Jackson WY, I also assisted MusicLand’s director with fundraising events such as Old Bill’s Fun Run, a community non-profit fundraiser half-marathon run.</p>

		    <p>I have played the violin for 16 years, during this time I have performed many solo recitals and orchestral concerts.&nbsp; My orchestral journey began in Louisville KY, where I was a member of the Louisville Youth Orchestra for 7 years, then, in college I was a member of Hanover’s community orchestra.&nbsp; I also participated in the Jackson Hole Symphony community orchestra as well as volunteering in MusicLand’s youth orchestra program.</p>
